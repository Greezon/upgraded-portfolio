# About.... Me!

### I attemped to make a bio using bootstrap. In doing so I gained a mountain of knowledge. A tip of the iceberg included a grid system, image fluidity, positioning, specificity, dev tools, and so much more. I really focused on making this project reveal the things I love. I forced myself to create, copy, and manage the directory through the Terminal.

## HTML

### I started playing around with the nav bar, and fleshing out what I wanted the theme of my page to be. Once I was satisfied with the way things looked, used what was on my homepage as a template. 

#### Homepage
Working on my homepage was a bit of a struggle, until I discovered image fluidity, and researched on positioning behavior. My background proved to be most problematic, i did however get it to respond the way I thought it should.

#### Portfolio Page
My portfolio page was the most fun to make. I started with a few keywords, and moved from there. After I decided on that I had to fight with my images, and bootstrap rows, and columns.  Most of all fluidity, and size. I am really happy with the way it looks, and has come out. I did create a sticky footer, and had to apply padding to the bottom of my last image to make it look right.


#### Contact Page
My contact page in my opinion was the easiest page to work on because I had already learned so much forming my portfolio, and homepage. I put the mp4 video in there so someone may actually want to contact me.
    
## CSS

The styling that I added to this page was mostly hover effect. I spent the most time trying to figure out how to make things "POP".
   
# What I learned
When looking at webpages now, I find that I can build them, change them, and most of all make them better. I also found that I really enjoy figuring out all of the behavior of websites.
